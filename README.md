# Haskell Discovery

Welcome to the **Haskell Discovery** repository! This repository contains a variety of Haskell exercises

## Current Section: List Comprehensions

The current set of assignments focuses on using Haskell list comprehensions to solve elementary school math problems.

### Assignments

The assignments cover various topics and concepts, including:
- Generating sequences of numbers
- Filtering lists based on conditions
- Transforming list elements
- Working with pairs and tuples
- Implementing classic problems like FizzBuzz

### Solutions

For each assignment, you will find both a specific solution and a generalized function. These solutions are implemented using Haskell list comprehensions, demonstrating how powerful and versatile list comprehensions can be.

## About the Assignments

The assignments provided in this section were generated with the assistance of ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, based on my reading of the list comprehensions chapter in "Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!". I was inspired to create small math-like examples that could be interesting for school as well.

## Future Sections

This repository will be continuously updated with new Haskell exercises covering various topics as I continue to learn and explore the language. Stay tuned for more exercises and solutions on different aspects of Haskell programming.
